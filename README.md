# Kotlin Programming Practice

This is a Kotlin programming practice repository aimed at demonstrating the usage of design patterns, data structures, and algorithms in the Kotlin language. The project showcases how to implement these concepts in Kotlin and can serve as a reference for those looking to improve their Kotlin programming skills.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any other Java IDE
3. Wait for the IDE to build the project and install any missing dependencies.
4. You are now ready to start exploring the code and practicing your Kotlin skills.

## Design Patterns

## Data Structures

The repository contains examples of the following data structures:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
